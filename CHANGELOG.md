## [v1.12.3]

> Release date: 2022/07/05

### Added

- Add rate-limiting capabilities to Konnect client.
  [#705](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/705)

## [v1.12.2]

> Release date: 2022/06/06

### Fixes

- Only include referenced objects IDs in API requests to fix issue with Konnect.
  [#693](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/693)
- Make Oauth2Credential's `redirect_uris` field not required as it's been so
  since Kong `1.4.0`.
  [#688](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/688)

## [v1.12.1]

> Release date: 2022/05/13

### Added

- Log descriptive names when configuring plugins on other entities.
  [#662](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/662)
- Docker images now include `jq` to assist with pre-processing environment
  substitutions.
  [#660](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/660)

### Fixes

- Service's `enabled` field is now correctly parsed when present in config files.
  [#677](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/677)
- Route references to services by name are now properly handled when printing
  diffs.
  [#657](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/657)
- decK  uses its own user-agent header value for Konnect commands also.
  [#654](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/654)


## [v1.12.0]

> Release date: 2022/04/22

### Added

- Inject decK version into `User-Agent` header for requests originating from decK
  [#652](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/652)

  `deck konnect` is now considered deprecated.
  [#645](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/645)
- Added `--skip-ca-certificates` flag. When present, decK will not attempt to
  sync CA certificates. This assists with using decK to manage multiple
  workspaces. CA certificates do not belong to a specific workspace, but can be
  seen and managed through workspaced endpoints. decK will attempt to
  remove them if they are not present in a state file when syncing a workspace,
  even if they were created for use with configuration in another workspace.
  [#617](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/617)
- Users can no longer set default values for fields where a default value
  does not make sense (such as fields with unique constraints, like `id`), and
  will print an error indicating the restricted field.
  [#613](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/613)
- Universal binaries are now available for OS X.
  [#585](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/585)

### Fixes

- Fixed unreliable diff outputs due to external dependency (gojsondiff).
  [#538](https://github.com/Kong/deck/issues/538)
- De-duplicated `select_tags` in file metadata to avoid erroneous mismatch
  reports when using `--select-tags` with multiple state files.
  [#623](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/623)

- Fixed a regression that broke workspace creation in v1.11.0.
  [#608](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/608)
- Fixed a regression that broke plugins dedup feature in v1.11.0.
  [#594](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/594)
- Invalid YAML in state files no longer parses as an empty target state.
  [#590](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/590)

- decK prevents user interaction with any internal-only Konnect plugins.
  [#564](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/564)
- decK now supports mTLS Kong Admin API authentication via
  `--tls-client-cert`/`--tls-client-cert-file` and
  `--tls-client-key`/`--tls-client-key-file` flags.
  [#509](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/509)
- decK `validate` now has an `--online` flag enabling entity validation against
  the Admin API. This lets users validate their configuration before deploying it.
  [#502](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/502)

### Fixes

- decK now can set zero values (`false`, `""`, `0`) in entity fields.
  [#580](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/580)
- Attempting to run `sync` on multiple workspaces now returns an error
  rather than applying a single workspace to all entities.
  [#576](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/576)
- Skip `consumers` when using `--skip-consumers` with the `sync` command.
  [#559](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/559)

## [v1.9.0]

> Release date: 2021/12/09

### Breaking changes

- The https://hub.docker.com/r/hbagdi/deck image is deprecated. 1.8.2 is the
  last release uploaded to it. You must switch to https://hub.docker.com/r/kong/deck
  to use 1.9.0 and future releases.

### Added

- decK now handles `_transform` state file metadata.
  [#520](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/520)

### Fixed

- `--select-tag` applies its tags to newly-created entities whether or not the
  tag is also present in the state file metadata.
  [#517](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/517)
- Timeouts in `Syncer.Run()` now return an error instead of syncing only a
  subset of the requested changes and reporting success. Downstream clients
  using decK as a library can determine when their sync attempt failed due to a

- decK now support defaults. This feature helps with avoiding repetition of common
  fields in Kong's configuration and instead specifying them in a single place.
  [#419](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/419)
- A new `--timeout` flag has been added to the root command to specify timeouts
  in seconds for various requests to Kong.
  [#450](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/450)

### Fixed

- Fix a data race with operations counters
  [#381](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/381)

- A security policy has been added to the repository

## [v1.7.0]

> Release date: 2021/05/20

### Added

- State files now support environment variable-based templating. decK can
  substitute the value of an environment variable into an object in the state
  file. This is useful for avoiding persistent cleartext storage of sensitive
  values and populating values that vary between similar configurations.
  [#286](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/286)
- Sort state file objects by name, to ease comparing state files from
  similarly-configured instances that do not share object IDs.
  [#327](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/327)
- Added a default timeout to HTTP requests.

- Implemented `convert` command for converting state files between Kong Gateway
  and Konnect configuration formats. This is aimed to solving migration problem between
  on-premise Kong clusters and Konnect SaaS.
  [#330](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/330)
- Add `--konnect-addr` flag to set Konnect address. This can be used to target Konnect
  data-centers in geographical regions other than the US.
  [#374](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/374)
- Added support for document objects for Service Packages and Versions in Konnect.
  [#388](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/388)

### Fixed

- Fixed duplicate error message prints.
  [#317](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/317)
- Handle mtls-auth credential API behavior when Kong Enterprise is running in
  free mode. decK no longer treats the free mode mtls-auth behavior as a fatal
  error.

- `--select-tag` tags are now applied to credentials.
  [#282](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/282)
- Fix empty Service Package descriptions not syncing correctly.
  [#347](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/347)
- Updating certificate fields no longer deletes SNI associations.
  [#386](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/386)

### Misc

### Added

- decK now prompts by default before overwriting existing state files when
  dumping config. Including `--yes` in args assumes yes and overwrites state
  files without prompting.
  [#285](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/285)

### Misc

- Removed analytics.
  [#301](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/301)

### Breaking changes

- Changed `github.com/blang/semver` module to `github.com/blang/semver/v4`. If
  you use decK's `file` package in other applications, you will also need to
  update the semver module used in your application.
  [#303](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/303)

## [v1.5.1]

> Release date: 2021/03/23

### Fixed

- Targets with identical IP and port values no longer conflict when created for
  different upstreams.
  [#280](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/280)
- Fixed issue where Konnect flag defaults overwrote non-Konnect flag defaults,
  which broke the `--all-workspaces` flag.
  [#290](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/290)
- Diff output no longer prints resource timestamp information.
  [#283](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/283)
- Tracebacks no longer include unwanted information specific to the build
  environment.
  [#284](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/284)

## [v1.5.0]

> Release date: 2021/03/06

### Added

- decK now supports Kong Konnect. Configuration for Kong Konnect can be exported,
  diffed and synced using decK. A new command `konnect` has been introduced for
  this purpose, which has 4 sub-commands: `ping`, `dump`, `diff`, and  `sync`.
  This feature in decK is currently in `alpha` state, which means there can be
  breaking changes to these commands in future releases.
- decK now supports two new Kong Enterprise resources: RBAC role and RBAC
  endpoint-permission. Special thanks to [@tjrivera](https://github.com/tjrivera)
  for this contribution. A new flag `--rbac-resources-only` has been introduced
  to manage RBAC-only configuration via decK.
  [#276](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/276)
- Certificates and Kong Services can now be managed separately. A check for
  existence of Certificate has been relaxed to make this possible.
  [#269](https://github.com/Kong/deck/pull/269)

## [v1.4.0]

> Release date: 2021/02/01

### Added

- deck now handles the `request_buffering` and `response_buffering` options for `Route`

  [#201](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/pull/201)
- decK prints descriptive information about duplicated entities.
  [#204](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/pull/204)

### Fixed

- Resolved a concurrency bug during syncs.
  [#202](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/pull/202)

## [v1.2.1]

> Release date: 2020/08/04

  during a `sync` operation.
  [#187](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/pull/187)
- Added `--workspace` flag to `ping` command. This can be used to verify
  connectivity with Kong Enterprise when running as an RBAC role with lower
  priviliges.
- New `--workspace` flag for `diff` and `sync` command to provide workspace
  via the CLI instead of state file. Workspace defined in state file will be
  overriden if this flag is provided.
- New `--skip-workspace-crud` flag to skip any workspace related operations.
  This flag can be used when running as as an RBAC role with lower priviliges.
  The content can be synced to specific workspaces but decK will not attempt

  flag. Use `-s` multiple times or specify multiple files/directories using
  a comma separated list.
  [#137](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/pull/137)
- **Performance**
  decK should be much faster than before. Requests to Kong are
  now concurrent. `dump`, `sync`, `diff` and `reset`
  commands will be faster than before, by at least 2x.
- SNI entity in Kong is not supported natively supported
  [#139](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/pull/139). Most users will not observe

> Release date: 2019/11/08

### Fixed

- Check for workspace makes call the right endpoint
  [#94](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/94)
- Error checking is performed correctly when ensuring existence of a workspace
  [#95](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/95)
- Multiple upstream definitions are read correctly and synced up
  [#96](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/96)

## [v0.6.0]

> Release date: 2019/11/03

### Breaking changes

- `ID` field is required for `Certificate` entity. Previous state files will
  break if `ID` is not present on this entity. You can use `dump` command
  to generate new state files which includes the `ID` field.
- SNIs are exported under the `name` key under Certificate entity to match
  Kong's declarative configuration format.

### Added

- Kong's configuration can now be synced/diffed/dumped using JSON format,
  in addition to the existing YAML format. Use the `--format` flag to specify
  the format.
  [#35](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/35)
- Plugins associated with multiple entities e.g. a plugin for a combination of
  route and a consumer in Kong are now supported.
  [#13](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/13)
- JSON-schema based validation is now performed on the input file(s) for every
  command.
- New `validate` command has been added to validate an existing state file.
  This performs a JSON-schema based sanity check on the file along-with foreign
  reference checks to check for dangling pointers.
- Service-less routes are now supported by decK.
- `name` is no longer a required field  for routes and services entities
  in Kong. If a `name` is not present, decK exports the entity with it's `ID`.
- Client-certificates on Service entity are now a supported.
- Credential entities like key-auth, basic-auth now support tagging.
- `--parallelism` flag has been added to `sync` and `diff` commands to control
  the number of concurrenty request to Kong's Admin API.
  [#85](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/85)
- `diff` and `sync` show a descriptive error when a workspace doesn't exist
  for Kong Enterprise.
  [102ed5dd](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/commit/102ed5dd6f8ef)
- `--select-tag` flag has been added to `diff` and `sync` command for use-cases
  where the tags are not part of the state file. It is not recommended to
  use these flags unless you know what you are doing.
  [#81](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/81)
- ID for any entity can now be specified. decK previously ignored the ID for
  any entity if one was specified. Entities can also be exported with the `ID`
  field set using `--with-id` flag on the `dump` command.
  [#29](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/29)

### Fixed

- decK runs as non-root user in the Docker image.
  [#82](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/82)
- SNIs are now exported same as Kong's format i.e. they are exported under a
  `name` key under the certificates entity.
  [#76](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/76)
- Errors are made more descriptive in few commands.
- decK's binary inside the Docker image now contains versioning information.
  [#38](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/38)


### Internal

- Go has been bumped up to `1.13.4`.
- `go-kong` has been bumped up to `v0.10.0`.
- Reduced memory allocation, which should result in less GC pressure.

## [v0.5.2]

> Release date: 2019/09/15

### Added

- `-w/--workspace` flag has been added to the `reset` command to reset a
  specific workspace in Kong Enterprise.
  [#74](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/74)
- `--all-workspaces` flag has been added to the `reset` command to reset
  all workspaces in Kong Enterprise.
  [#74](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/74)
- A warning is logged when basic-auth credentials are being synced.
  [#49](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/49)

### Fixed

- Kong Enterprise Developer Portal exposes the credentials (basic/key) of
  Developers on the Admin API, but doesn't expose the consumers causing
  issues during export. decK now ignores these credentials in Kong Enterprise.
  [#75](https://github.com/hbagdi/deck/issues/75)

### Internal

- Go version has been bumped to 1.13.

## [v0.5.1]

> Release date: 2019/08/24
