# Backup and restore of Kong's configuration

You can use decK to backup and restore the entire or only a subset of
Kong's configuration.

To back up Kong's configuration, use the `dump` command:

```shell
$ deck dump
# this generates a kong.yaml file with the entire configuration of Kong
```

And then restore this file back to Kong using `sync` command:

```shell
$ deck diff # a dry-run where decK shows the changes it will perform
$ deck sync # actually re-creates the entities in Kong
```

## Manage a sub-set of configuration

You can export/import/manage a sub-set of Kong's configuration using
`select-tag` feature of decK. This is similar to adopting
[distributed configuration](distributed-configuration.md) for Kong.

The `select-tag` feature assumes that all the entities you would like to manage
in Kong share a common tag(s).

Assuming you've such a common tag, let's call it `foo-tag`, then you can
do the following to export only a subset of the configuration:

```
deck dump --select-tag foo-tag
```

If you observe the file generated by decK, you will see the following section:

```yaml
_info:
  select_tags:
  - foo-tag
```

This sub-section tells decK to filter out entities containing select-tags during
a sync operation.

Now, you can manage or sync back only this sub-set of configuration of Kong.
